# pi-interactive-subagents

Async subagents for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Spawn a sub-agent, keep working in the main session, and get the result steered back when it finishes. Fully non-blocking.

Children run either in **tmux panes** (the historical backend) or as **headless `pi --mode rpc` processes** — no multiplexer required. The backend picks itself: tmux when a server is available, headless RPC when it isn't. See [Surfaces](#surfaces).

**Fork of a tmux-only fork.** See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for the upstream project, which also supports cmux, zellij, and WezTerm.

## How it works

`subagent()` returns immediately. With tmux, the sub-agent runs in its own pane — a right split off the parent pi pane, so pane creation never steals keyboard focus. Without tmux (or with the backend forced to `rpc`), the sub-agent is spawned headless over pi's JSONL RPC mode and its transcript is tracked in-process. A live widget above the input tracks every running sub-agent either way, and when one finishes, its result is steered into the main session as a notification that triggers a new turn.

```
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────────────── 2 running ─╮

│ 00:45  scout-2    waiting 2m                       │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Spawn several in parallel — they run concurrently and steer results back independently as each finishes.

On the tmux backend, panes are kept evenly sized: the extension re-applies an `even-horizontal` layout after every spawn and exit (debounced). The layout is a single constant, `SUBAGENT_TMUX_LAYOUT` in `pi-extension/subagents/tmux.ts` — change it to any named tmux layout (`main-vertical`, `tiled`, …).

If your shell startup is slow and launch commands get dropped before the prompt is ready, raise the delay:

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_SHELL_READY_DELAY_MS=2500   # default: 500
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent` | Spawn a sub-agent on a dedicated surface (async) |
| `subagent_message` | Message a sub-agent by name — steers it if running, resumes its session if finished |
| `subagents_list` | List available agent definitions |
| `ask_question` | *(sub-agent sessions only)* Ask the orchestrator a question and wait for the reply |

There is also a `/subagent <agent> <task>` command for spawning directly.

### Spawning

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "scout", task: "Analyze the auth module" });
subagent({ agent: "worker", name: "dark-mode", task: "Implement the dark mode toggle" });
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `agent` | string | required | Which agent to spawn (must be known and permitted) |
| `task` | string | required | Task prompt |
| `name` | string | agent name | Display name for the pane and widget. Must be unique — duplicates are auto-suffixed (`scout`, `scout-2`, …) |
| `model` | string | agent's model | Override the model for this spawn |
| `cwd` | string | agent's `cwd` | Working directory (see [Role folders](#role-folders)) |

### Messaging

`subagent_message` is addressed **by name only**. Names are unique per session and persist after a sub-agent finishes, so the same name works either way:

```typescript
subagent_message({ name: "scout", message: "Also check the auth middleware" });
```

- **Running** — the message is typed into the live pane (newlines flattened) and picked up at the next turn boundary; headless children receive it verbatim as their next prompt once the current run finishes. The call returns immediately; the eventual completion still arrives as a steer message. If the child exited in between, the tool fails with an error instead of silently dropping the message.
- **Finished** — the session is resumed with the message as the follow-up task, like a fresh spawn: fire-and-forget, always autonomous, result steered back later. The resumed run reclaims its original name.

Every spawn records name → session file in `artifacts/<sessionId>/subagent-registry.json`, so names stay addressable across pi restarts. A nested sub-agent that spawns children gets its own registry keyed by its own session id. Resume is refused with a clear error (listing known names) if the name isn't registered, the session file is gone, or the session predates sandboxed resume.

**Resume replays the original sandbox.** At spawn time the fully-resolved loadout — tool allowlist, backing extensions, model, thinking level, system prompt, spawn whitelist, cwd — is snapshotted to `<session>.loadout.json`. Resume rebuilds the exact same restricted process from that snapshot rather than relaunching unrestricted.

### ask_question

A sub-agent can ask its orchestrator a single freeform question when requirements are ambiguous or a decision materially affects the work. The session **stays open** (parked as `waiting`) instead of exiting; the parent is notified with the sub-agent's name, replies via `subagent_message({ name, message })`, and the reply arrives as the sub-agent's next turn. Parallel questions are supported — each waiting sub-agent has its own name.

If the reply arrives while the sub-agent is still mid-turn, it is absorbed into the current turn — either way the question is marked answered and the session exits normally when the work is done. If the parent never replies, the pane stays open until a human closes it. Only available inside sub-agent sessions.

## Bundled agents

| Agent | Model | Tools | Role |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| **scout** | `openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3` | `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` | Fast read-only codebase recon |
| **researcher** | `openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3` | `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `safe_bash` | Web research, synthesized into a sourced brief |
| **worker** | `openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3` | `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `web_search`, `web_fetch` + spawning | General implementer; may spawn `scout` and `researcher` |

All three are autonomous (`auto-exit: true`) and carry their identity in the system prompt (`system-prompt: append`).

## Custom agents

Place a `.md` file in `.pi/agents/` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global). Discovery priority: **project > global > package-bundled** — a project-local file overrides a bundled agent with the same name.

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Does something specific
model: openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3
thinking: medium
tools: read, edit, write, safe_bash, web_search
session-mode: lineage-only
auto-exit: true
---

You are a specialized agent that does X...
```

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | Agent name (used in `agent: "my-agent"`) |
| `description` | string | Shown in `subagents_list` |
| `model` | string | Default model |
| `thinking` | string | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, or `high` |
| `tools` | string | Strict tool allowlist. Built-ins: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`. Extension-backed: `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `safe_bash`, `video_extract`, `youtube_search`, `google_image_search`. Only the extensions backing the listed tools are loaded into the child |
| `subagent_agents` | string | Comma-separated agent names this agent may spawn. **Presence of this field grants the spawning toolset** (`subagent`, `subagent_message`, `subagents_list`) and restricts spawn targets to the list. Omit it and the agent cannot spawn at all |
| `skills` | string | Comma-separated skill names to auto-load |
| `session-mode` | string | `standalone` (default), `lineage-only`, or `fork` — see below |
| `system-prompt` | string | `append` or `replace`: pass the body as the child's `--append-system-prompt` / `--system-prompt`. Omit and the body is prepended to the task prompt instead |
| `auto-exit` | boolean | Auto-shutdown when the agent finishes (see below) |
| `interactive` | boolean | Whether stall/recovery transitions wake the parent (see below) |
| `cwd` | string | Default working directory |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | Hide from `subagents_list`; still spawnable by explicit name |
| `cli` | string | `claude` runs the agent via the Claude Code CLI instead of pi |

### session-mode

- `standalone` — fresh session, no lineage link to the caller (default)
- `lineage-only` — fresh session with `parentSession` linkage for discovery/fork UX, but no copied turns
- `fork` — child session seeded with the caller's conversation context

### auto-exit

With `auto-exit: true`, the session shuts down when the agent's turn ends — the agent just writes its final message and stops (there is no "done" tool). The last assistant message becomes the summary returned to the parent. Recommended for all autonomous agents.

Notes:

- **Manual input does not strand an auto-exit sub-agent.** If a human types into the pane, the session still closes once that turn completes normally — only an escape/abort leaves it open.
- **Auto-exit is suppressed while work is in flight:** the session parks as `waiting` instead of exiting when an `ask_question` is still unanswered, or when the agent's own child sub-agents are still running (a worker can stop after dispatching children and stays open until the last result returns).

### interactive

Controls whether `stalled`/`recovered` status transitions send a steer message to the parent session. Defaults to the inverse of `auto-exit`: autonomous agents get stall pings; user-driven agents stay quiet (the user is already working in that pane — the widget still updates). Set explicitly to override.

## Tool access control

Access is **whitelist-only**. Every sub-agent process is launched with `--no-extensions` (extension discovery disabled) and `--tools <allowlist>`; only the extensions backing the listed tools are loaded back in explicitly. There is no default toolset and no deny-list — an agent gets exactly what its frontmatter lists. The restriction survives resume via the loadout snapshot.

Spawns must name a known agent at **every** depth. A top-level session may spawn anything discoverable; a sub-agent may only spawn the agents in its `subagent_agents` list (enforced via `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOWED`). There is no agentless spawn route, so a child can never escalate to a full-toolset profile by omitting its agent.

Extensions can register additional tools for sub-agents at runtime via `registerToolExtension(name, path)` on the `__pi_interactive_subagents` process global.

## Role folders

`cwd` starts a sub-agent in a directory with its own config, so role-specific setups (CLAUDE.md, skills, extensions) apply:

```
project/
└── agents/
    ├── game-designer/   ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
    └── sre/             ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
```

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "worker", cwd: "agents/sre", task: "Review the deployment pipeline" });
```

Set a per-agent default with `cwd:` in frontmatter.

## Status widget & configuration

The widget tracks each sub-agent from a runtime activity snapshot written by the child: `starting`, `active` (turn/provider/tool work), `waiting` (open for input or another stage), `stalled` (no valid snapshot for too long), or `running` (fallback). Sub-agent sessions also show their own tools widget — toggle it with `Ctrl+Alt+O`. Completion messages expand with `Ctrl+O`.

Status display is configured via `config.json` in the extension directory (copy `config.json.example`; it's gitignored):

```json
{
  "status": { "enabled": true }
}
```

## Surfaces

A *surface* is where a sub-agent child lives. Two backends implement the same five primitives (create, send, read, close, poll-for-exit):

- **tmux** — the historical backend. Children run in panes of a `pi` window; you can attach and watch them live.
- **rpc** — headless children via `pi --mode rpc`, spawned directly by the extension (JSONL over stdio, no shell, no multiplexer). Their transcripts are tracked in-process and shown in the [panes dashboard](#panes-dashboard).

Selection order: env `PI_SUBAGENT_SURFACE` > `config.json` > `auto`. The default, `auto`, keeps tmux panes when a tmux server is reachable and falls back to headless RPC children otherwise — so the extension works with zero setup outside tmux, and inside tmux nothing changes. Claude-CLI agents always use tmux (the `claude` CLI has no RPC mode).

```json
{
  "surface": {
    "backend": "auto",
    "panes": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

Env overrides for one-off runs: `PI_SUBAGENT_SURFACE=rpc|tmux|auto` and `PI_SUBAGENT_PANES=0|1`.

Exit detection is identical in kind on both backends: the child-side `subagent-done` extension writes a `.exit` sidecar on error stops and shuts down on completion; the tmux backend additionally screen-scrapes a sentinel, the RPC backend additionally watches the child process exit. On pi < 0.80.4, auto-exit RPC children are nudged with a cheap informational command after their final run (that pi version only consumes the child's shutdown flag on the next handled command); pi ≥ 0.80.4 emits `agent_settled` and exits on its own. pi ≥ 0.65 is required either way.

Every launch is written to an artifact next to the session file for debugging: `<name>-<id>.sh` (the exact shell command typed into the pane) or `<name>-<id>.rpc.json` (argv, env, cwd, and prompts for the headless spawn).

## Panes dashboard

`Ctrl+Alt+P` toggles an in-pi overlay with live transcripts of every running sub-agent — both backends. It is non-capturing: while visible but unfocused, it never steals a keystroke from pi's editor. Focus it (the shortcut does that on open) and you can navigate panes with `tab`/`shift+tab`, open a composer with `enter`, and steer a sub-agent directly — the same code path the LLM's `subagent_message` uses. A failed steer (e.g. the child exited) keeps the composer open and shows the reason in the footer. `q` hides the dashboard; `escape` releases the keyboard back to pi while keeping it visible.

## Requirements

- [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) ≥ 0.65 (≥ 0.80.4 recommended for headless children)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) — *optional*. Only needed if you want children in observable panes or use Claude-CLI agents.

With tmux:

```bash
tmux new -A -s pi 'pi'
```

Without tmux, just run `pi` — children spawn headless.
